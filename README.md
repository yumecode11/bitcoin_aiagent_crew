# ðŸ¤–ðŸ’³ðŸ¤– Stacks M2M

## Agents with Wallets

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an early experiment, agents do automatic things, here be dragons, run at your own risk.

## Choosing an LLM

CrewAI allows for multiple model configurations, from using OpenAI/Microsoft Azure APIs to running local models, [see the documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/#configuration-examples) for more info on how to configure for your specific needs. An example env file (`.env.example`) is provided.

Current testing is being done with [Text generation web UI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)

- temperature 0.01
- seed 1234567890
- miqu-70b-q5_k_m
- 32k context length

Command to run Text generation web UI:
`python server.py --api --verbose`

Command to run Text generation web UI on another machine:
`python server.py --api --verbose --listen`

If you already have local models downloaded, you can specify the model directory for Text generation web UI to read from:
`python server.py --model-dir /path/to/your/model_files --listen --api --verbose`

Once running, access the web UI at port 7860 and:

- On the `Model` tab, select the model to load
- (optional) On the `Parameters - Generation` tab, set custom parameters for the model
- On the `Model` tab, load the model and wait until "Successfully loaded" appears

> [!TIP]
> The IP address and port of the model running on Text generation web UI should be set in `.env` to use a local model.

## Setting up the Wallet

This repository also imports the `stacks-m2m/scripts` repository as a submodule.

This provides Typescript functions to interact with a Stacks wallet using Stacks.js.

To clone the repository and sync the submodule, run the following command:

- ssh: `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:stacks-m2m/crew.git`
- https: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stacks-m2m/crew.git`

To update the submodule, run the following command:
`git submodule update --remote --merge`

Within the `scripts` directory is a `.env.example` file that should be copied to `.env` and filled out with the wallet information.

Within the `scripts/src` directory are various scripts that can be run to interact with the wallet. These should be wrapped as a langchain `@tool` for LLMs to access it.

## Local Development

### CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://crewai.io) provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing agents, tasks, tools, and crews. It is built on top of [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), a decentralized, open-source, and privacy-focused AI platform.

- **Agents:** a team member; an autonomous unit programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communication with other agents
- **Tasks:** a task; individual assignments that agents complete
- **Tools:** a skill; single-input functions that agents can use to complete tasks (can use [any Langchain tool](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/) or define custom ones)
- **Crew:** a collaborative group; a group of agents that work together to complete a set of tasks

### Agents

- Agent definitions are in the `agents.py` file

### Tools

- Tool definitions are in the `/tools` directory
