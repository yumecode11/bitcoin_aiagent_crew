  - SWE-agent is a stunning paper that demonstrates the importance of designing llm-native interfaces for LLMs in software engineering.
  - The authors emphasize the need to move away from traditional human-centric interfaces like GUI-based IDEs and instead focus on creating interfaces that are tailored to the unique needs of LLMs.
  - The paper suggests that the future of software engineering lies in developing custom ACIs that enable seamless interaction between LLMs and codebases.
  - This shift towards specialized interfaces could lead to new startup opportunities and innovations in the field of ACIs, similar to the evolution of the API ecosystem.
  - The potential for LLMs to design and implement their own interfaces in real-time raises questions about value accrual and the future implications of this technology.
